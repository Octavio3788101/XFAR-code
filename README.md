Decided against using Pyroelectric sensor for the fire detecting and replaced it with a picture based recognition software called OpenCV Haar Cascade.

180kg-capable mounted servo with pan and tilt functionality.

Used both the laptop GPU alongside the Python based fire detection to move to the direction of the fire and turn on the device to eliminate it.
